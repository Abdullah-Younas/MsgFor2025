            <p>I hope you are reading this on the same exact day
                on 11/18/2025.
                If not than dont worry, atleast you are still
                reading this.
                This is just a short msg for the upcoming future,
                No one knows how it'll end up except for allah.
                But just dont giveup.
                You're not a kid anymore. You are 20 years old
                So giveup any habits that you took with you from
                2023. Throw them, Focus on goals/studies.
                These things will just waste your time and energy
                Your valuable time which is 100times greater than
                money and energy. Which you wont have in the years 
                Near in the future.
                So yea Thats it From Me.
                See ya.
            </p>
